# LearnMate â€“ Project Summary

LearnMate addresses the common challenge students face in choosing the right learning path due to the overwhelming number of online courses and lack of personalized guidance.

Using IBM Watsonx AI Studio and Granite foundation models, LearnMate acts as an Agentic AI coach that understands student interests, goals, and current skill levels. It then dynamically generates a personalized course roadmap that adapts over time based on student progress and feedback.

The system uses synthetic datasets, NLP techniques, and retrieval-based AI to simulate realistic learning guidance. Built entirely using free tools like Google Colab, Streamlit, and GitHub, the project demonstrates how AI can be used to enhance educational outcomes.

LearnMate not only simulates a smart recommendation engine, but also aligns with real-world IBM Cloud technologies to showcase how scalable, intelligent, and adaptive learning agents can be built. This project is a complete prototype ready for demonstration and future expansion in the EdTech space.
